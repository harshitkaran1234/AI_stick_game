# AI_stick_game 

This is a simple learning AI created using C++ map class. 
The AI will attempt to beat the human player in the Game of Sticks. 
The Game of Sticks is played between two players, in which 
a fixed number of starting sticks is on the board. A player
may take at least 1 stick and at most 3 sticks, and the player
that picks up the last stick loses. 
The AI is redundant for this game since there is a fixed 
and solvable solution, however it was a simple way for me 
to get started with AI. The project is based off an 
assignment I found online from
